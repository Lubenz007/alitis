## Choosing the Right Filament for Autodarts Parts

When printing parts for your Autodarts setup, the choice of filament is important for ensuring durability and print quality. The two most common and recommended materials are **PLA** and **PETG**.

### PLA (Polylactic Acid)

PLA is the most popular 3D printing material for a reason. It's easy to print, affordable, and comes in a wide variety of colors.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Very easy to print with minimal warping.
    *   Good detail and surface finish.
    *   Stiff and rigid, which is great for mounts.
    *   Environmentally friendly (biodegradable).

*   **Cons:**
    *   Lower heat resistance. If your setup is in a hot environment (like a garage in summer or direct sunlight), it could deform.
    *   More brittle than PETG.

**Recommendation:** For most indoor setups, PLA is an excellent and cost-effective choice.

### PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

PETG is a great alternative to PLA, offering better durability and heat resistance.

*   **Pros:**
    *   More durable and less brittle than PLA.
    *   Higher temperature resistance.
    *   Good chemical resistance.

*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be more difficult to print with, often requiring higher temperatures and careful retraction settings to avoid "stringing".
    *   Can be more expensive than PLA.

**Recommendation:** If your dartboard setup is in an area with fluctuating temperatures or if you want maximum durability for your parts, PETG is the superior choice.

### Conclusion

For beginners and standard indoor use, **start with PLA**. If you encounter issues with parts breaking or warping due to heat, or if you're an experienced printer looking for a more robust solution, **use PETG**.
