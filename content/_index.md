We specialize in generating comprehensive Azure and Microsoft 365 reports tailored to meet our customers' unique needs. Using our proprietary code, we create insightful reports that offer valuable visibility into your cloud and collaboration environments.

We are committed to collaboration and transparency. In addition to our own code, we integrate high-quality scripts and tools from other respected developers, always giving full credit to these contributors. To further empower our customers, we provide full access to all our code, allowing you to review, modify, and build upon it as needed.

Every report we produce undergoes thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. Once validated, we deploy these reports into your environment, where they can be accessed via a custom Teams app or a Hugo site designed for Teams.

For the Teams app, the data is securely stored in your private SharePoint environment, providing a safe and accessible location for your sensitive information. For reports delivered through Hugo, the data is stored on a static site, ensuring fast and efficient content delivery.

Both the Teams app and Hugo site deployments are managed through continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, ensuring automated, smooth, and reliable processing and updates.

Our primary service is to display these reports.

With our service, you receive critical insights into your cloud environments, backed by a commitment to quality, collaboration, and security, all while benefiting from automated, streamlined deployment processes.
